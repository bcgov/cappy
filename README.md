## About Cappy

Cappy is intended as a data catalogue of applications — an Application Catalogue.

It is built using [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com), which itself runs on [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

## Quick Setup (Using Docker + Sail)

### Windows Prerequisites (WSL + Docker Desktop)

```bash
# Install WSL
wsl --install

# Set WSL 2 as default
wsl --set-default-version 2

# Install Docker Desktop and ensure:
#   - WSL 2 engine is enabled (Settings → General → Use WSL 2 Based Engine)
#   - WSL Integration is enabled for your distro (Settings → WSL Integration)

# Set your default distro
wsl -s Ubuntu

# View installed distros (optional)
wsl --list

# Open WSL and navigate to your repo (example path)
cd /mnt/c/Users/{username}/Documents/GitHub/cappy
```

The following commands are the same for WSL, macOS, and Linux:

### Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

Sail is included automatically.

### (Optional) Add Sail Alias

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# or
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
alias sail='./vendor/bin/sail'
```

Restart your terminal.

### Start and Stop the Application

```bash
# Start
sail up -d

# Stop
sail down
```

---

## Environment Setup

### Create `.env`, App Key, Migrate, and Seed

```bash
cp .env.example .env
sail artisan key:generate
sail artisan migrate
sail artisan db:seed
```

### Optional: Connect with TablePlus

Use these connection details:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
User: sail
Password: password
Database: laravel
```

### Create Your User Account

```bash
sail artisan make:filament-user
```

By default you will receive the **user** role (view-only).

To assign **admin** or **editor**:

```bash
sail artisan assign-user-role
```

Your app should now be available at:

```
http://localhost/
```

---

## Developer Workflow: Adding New Content

```bash
# Create a model and migration
sail artisan make:model Test -m
```

Example migration structure:

```php
Schema::create('tests', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->timestamps();
});

Schema::dropIfExists('tests');
```

Run the migration:

```bash
sail artisan migrate
```

### Optional Seeder

```bash
sail artisan make:seeder TestSeeder
```

Example seeder:

```php
Test::create(['name' => 'Name One']);
Test::create(['name' => 'Name Two']);
```

Run the seeder:

```bash
sail artisan db:seed --class=TestSeeder
```

### Create Filament Resource

```bash
sail artisan make:filament-resource Test --view
```

Define the `form`:

```php
return $form->schema([
    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
]);
```

Define the `table`:

```php
return $table->columns([
    Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name')
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
]);
```

---

## Local Exports

Some views allow exporting CSV/Excel files. The queue worker should run automatically, but you may manually run it:

```bash
sail artisan queue:work
```

---

## Mail Provider (Mailhog)

Mailhog is available locally at:

```
http://localhost:8025
```

It will capture outgoing emails such as password reset messages.

# Deployment Details

## Database Setup

Cappy uses **PostgreSQL v17**. The database runs as a **standalone PostgreSQL instance** deployed inside OpenShift. Full installation and operational instructions are available in this repository:

**Database README:**
[https://github.com/kiiskila-bcgov/app-insight-platform/blob/main/postgres/README.md](https://github.com/kiiskila-bcgov/app-insight-platform/blob/main/postgres/README.md)

### Summary of the Deployment

* Standard **PostgreSQL v17** installation
* Deployed via **Helm** (no operator required)
* Works in any managed OpenShift environment
* Does **not** require cluster-admin permissions
* Runs as a **single-instance StatefulSet** backed by a PVC
* Uses the official `postgres:17-alpine` image

### Installation

Follow the steps in the linked README, which include:

1. Deploying the database via Helm:

   ```bash
   helm install postgres .
   ```

2. Verifying the StatefulSet and pod readiness:

   ```bash
   oc get statefulset postgres
   oc wait --for=condition=ready pod/postgres-0 --timeout=300s
   ```

3. Retrieving the autogenerated `postgres` password:

   ```bash
   oc get secret postgres-credentials \
     -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
   ```

### Connection Details

After deployment, the service will be available internally:

```
Host: postgres.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
Username: postgres
Password: (from the secret)
```

For local development access:

```bash
oc port-forward svc/postgres 5432:5432
```

Then connect with any PostgreSQL client (e.g., `psql`, TablePlus, DBeaver).

### Configuration Notes

You may customize your instance by editing `values.yaml`, including:

* Image version
* Resource requests/limits
* Storage size
* PostgreSQL config parameters

See the linked README for examples.

### Limitations

* This deployment is **not HA** (single pod)
* Intended for development and small-scale production workloads
* Stores data on a PVC (persists across restarts)
