## About Cappy

Cappy is intended as a data catalogue of applications — an Application Catalogue.

It is built using [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com), which itself runs on [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

---

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) 8.3
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/cappy.git
cd cappy
```

---

## Quick Setup (Using Docker + Sail)

### Windows Prerequisites (WSL + Docker Desktop)

```bash
# Install WSL
wsl --install

# Set WSL 2 as default
wsl --set-default-version 2

# Install Docker Desktop and ensure:
#   - WSL 2 engine is enabled (Settings → General → Use WSL 2 Based Engine)
#   - WSL Integration is enabled for your distro (Settings → WSL Integration)

# Set your default distro
wsl -s Ubuntu

# View installed distros (optional)
wsl --list

# Open WSL and navigate to your repo (example path)
cd /mnt/c/Users/{username}/Documents/GitHub/cappy
```

The following commands are the same for WSL, macOS, and Linux:

### Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

Sail is included automatically.

### (Optional) Add Sail Alias

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# or
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
alias sail='./vendor/bin/sail'
```

Restart your terminal.

### Start and Stop the Application

```bash
# Start
sail up -d

# Stop
sail down
```

---

## Environment Setup

### Create `.env`, App Key, Migrate, and Seed

```bash
cp .env.example .env
sail artisan key:generate
sail artisan migrate
sail artisan db:seed
```

### Optional: Connect with TablePlus

Use these connection details:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
User: sail
Password: password
Database: laravel
```

### Create Your User Account

```bash
sail artisan make:filament-user
```

By default you will receive the **user** role (view-only).

To assign **admin** or **editor**:

```bash
sail artisan assign-user-role
```

Your app should now be available at:

```
http://localhost/
```

---

## Developer Workflow: Adding New Content

```bash
# Create a model and migration
sail artisan make:model Test -m
```

Example migration structure:

```php
Schema::create('tests', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->timestamps();
});

Schema::dropIfExists('tests');
```

Run the migration:

```bash
sail artisan migrate
```

### Optional Seeder

```bash
sail artisan make:seeder TestSeeder
```

Example seeder:

```php
Test::create(['name' => 'Name One']);
Test::create(['name' => 'Name Two']);
```

Run the seeder:

```bash
sail artisan db:seed --class=TestSeeder
```

### Create Filament Resource

```bash
sail artisan make:filament-resource Test --view
```

Define the `form`:

```php
return $form->schema([
    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
]);
```

Define the `table`:

```php
return $table->columns([
    Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name')
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
]);
```

---

## Local Exports

Some views allow exporting CSV/Excel files. The queue worker should run automatically, but you may manually run it:

```bash
sail artisan queue:work
```

---

## Mail Provider (Mailhog)

Mailhog is available locally at:

```
http://localhost:8025
```

It will capture outgoing emails such as password reset messages.

# Deployment Details

## Database Setup

Cappy uses **PostgreSQL v17**. The database runs as a **standalone PostgreSQL instance** deployed inside OpenShift. Full installation and operational instructions are available in this repository:

**Database README:**
[https://github.com/kiiskila-bcgov/app-insight-platform/blob/main/postgres/README.md](https://github.com/kiiskila-bcgov/app-insight-platform/blob/main/postgres/README.md)

### Summary of the Deployment

* Standard **PostgreSQL v17** installation
* Deployed via **Helm** (no operator required)
* Works in any managed OpenShift environment
* Does **not** require cluster-admin permissions
* Runs as a **single-instance StatefulSet** backed by a PVC
* Uses the official `postgres:17-alpine` image

### Installation

Follow the steps in the linked README, which include:

1. Deploying the database via Helm:

   ```bash
   helm install postgres .
   ```

2. Verifying the StatefulSet and pod readiness:

   ```bash
   oc get statefulset postgres
   oc wait --for=condition=ready pod/postgres-0 --timeout=300s
   ```

3. Retrieving the autogenerated `postgres` password:

   ```bash
   oc get secret postgres-credentials \
     -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
   ```

### Connection Details

After deployment, the service will be available internally:

```
Host: postgres.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
Username: postgres
Password: (from the secret)
```

For local development access:

```bash
oc port-forward svc/postgres 5432:5432
```

Then connect with any PostgreSQL client (e.g., `psql`, TablePlus, DBeaver).

### Configuration Notes

You may customize your instance by editing `values.yaml`, including:

* Image version
* Resource requests/limits
* Storage size
* PostgreSQL config parameters

See the linked README for examples.

### Limitations

* This deployment is **not HA** (single pod)
* Intended for development and small-scale production workloads
* Stores data on a PVC (persists across restarts)

## Laravel Setup

Cappy is deployed to OpenShift using a custom Docker image, Helm charts, and GitHub Actions–based CI/CD. This section summarizes how the application is built and deployed.

### Container Image

The application image is defined in the project Dockerfile, which uses:

* **PHP 8.3 with Apache**
* Required system packages for PostgreSQL (`pdo_pgsql`,`pgsql`)
* Vite asset building via Node.js
* Composer dependencies installed with optimized autoloading
* Correct Apache configuration for a Laravel public directory
* Proper file permissions for storage, logs, and cache

Full Dockerfile:
[https://github.com/bcgov/cappy/blob/main/Dockerfile](https://github.com/bcgov/cappy/blob/main/Dockerfile)

The build process includes:

* Installing PHP extensions
* Running `npm install` and `npm run build`
* Running `composer install --no-dev`
* Setting up directory permissions
* Exposing port **8080**

### Deployment Using Helm (OpenShift)

The Helm chart handles all required OpenShift resources:

* Deployment (`cappy-app`)
* Worker Deployment (`cappy-queue-worker`)
* Service
* PVC for persistent storage
* NetworkPolicies

Helm chart location:
[https://github.com/bcgov/cappy/tree/main/helm](https://github.com/bcgov/cappy/tree/main/helm)

To deploy or upgrade manually:

```bash
helm upgrade --install cappy ./helm --set image.tag=<image-tag>
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

The repository includes a CI/CD workflow that:

1. Builds the Docker image
2. Pushes it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
3. Authenticates to OpenShift
4. Performs a Helm upgrade
5. Restarts deployments

Workflow file:
[https://github.com/bcgov/cappy/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yaml](https://github.com/bcgov/cappy/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yaml)

#### Required GitHub Environments

Create environments:

```
Settings → Environments → New Environment
```

Create two:

* `dev`
* `prod`

Each environment must define:

**Variables**

```
OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE=<your-namespace>
OPENSHIFT_SERVER=https://api.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca:6443
```

**Secrets**

```
OPENSHIFT_TOKEN=<service-account-token>
```

#### Creating the OpenShift Service Account Token

```bash
export SA=github-actions-sa
oc create sa $SA

# After OpenShift 4.12, tokens are not auto-generated.
# Create a token secret manually:
cat <<EOF > service-account-token.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-actions-sa-token
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: github-actions-sa
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
EOF

oc apply -f service-account-token.yaml
```

Then assign permissions:

```bash
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:github-actions-sa
```

After the secret appears in OpenShift, copy the **token** value into the `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` GitHub secret.

### Application Secrets (OpenShift)

Create an OpenShift secret named:

```
cappy-secrets
```

This secret must contain production environment values such as:

```
APP_KEY=<app-key>

DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DB_DATABASE=laravel

MAIL_HOST=apps.smtp.gov.bc.ca
MAIL_PORT=25

CACHE_DRIVER=database
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_NAME=cappy

APP_ENV=production
APP_TIMEZONE=America/Vancouver

ASSET_URL=<your-public-openshift-route>
APP_URL=<your-public-api-url>
```

Values should be adjusted for the target namespace/environment.
